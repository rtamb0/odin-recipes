# odin-recipes
This project will cultivate the HTML skills that I have learned up until now throughout the curriculum.
The project is about a basic recipe website, in which it will contain links that will take you to some of my favourite food recipes.
The website is not going to be pretty, as the project is intended to build my HTML skills. However, this project will be revisited when I am learning about CSS.
