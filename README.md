# odin-recipes
This project will cultivate the HTML skills that I have learned up until now throughout the curriculum.
It will be about building a basic recipe website. The website will contain links that will take you to some recipes.
The website will not turn out pretty, as the project is intended to build my HTML skills. However, this project will be revisited when learning about CSS.
