                <h3>Ingredients</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><em>3</em> eggs, <em>beaten</em></li>
                    <li><em>1 teaspoon</em> sunflower oil</li>
                    <li><em>1 teaspoon</em> butter</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Steps</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Season</strong> the beaten eggs well with salt and pepper. <strong>Heat</strong> the oil and butter in a <em>non-stick</em> frying pan over a <em>medium-low</em> heat until the butter has melted and is foaming.</li>
                    <li><strong>Pour</strong> the eggs into the pan, <strong>tilt</strong> the pan ever so slightly from one side to another to allow the eggs to swirl and cover the surface of the pan completely. Let the mixture cook for about <em>20 seconds</em> then <strong>scrape</strong> a line through the middle with a spatula.</li>
                    <li><strong>Tilt</strong> the pan again to allow it to fill back up with the runny egg. <strong>Repeat</strong> once or twice more until the egg has just set.</li>
                    <li>At this point you can fill the omelette with whatever you like - some grated cheese, sliced ham, fresh herbs, saut√©ed mushrooms or smoked salmon all work well. <strong>Scatter</strong> the filling over the top of the omelette and <strong>fold</strong> gently in half with the spatula. <strong>Slide</strong> onto a plate to serve.</li>
